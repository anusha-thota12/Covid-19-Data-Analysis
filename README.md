## Process
- Verified data for any missing values and sorted it.
- Used Power Query in Power BI to clean, remove blanks, and merge tables (cases, deaths, etc.).
- Created relationships between tables (like country, date, continent).
- Built charts and KPIs:
- Bar chart for country-wise cases
- Line chart for trends over time
- Pie charts for continents
- KPIs for total cases, deaths, new cases
- Age comparison by continent
- Added titles, colors, slicers, and clean layout for better understanding.
- Tested filters, checked all visuals, and published the dashboard.
